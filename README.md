# Welcome to QFluid_Dyn
This is a rempository of confused fluid dynamics. I don't know why there's a Q in the title, but there is and I'll just have to live with that.

So far this repo has barebones creation of an image with text and some colour using the 2D? rendering engine Allegro.

I picked Allegro because the installation was easy. I don't know if it was the right choice though.
